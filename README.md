# 📊 Netflix Pricing Tier LTV Experiment  
**Merged Test of Feature & Price Impact**

This case study simulates a pricing tier experiment for a subscription-based product like Netflix. It explores how a newly introduced Premium plan—with a higher price and enhanced features—impacts customer Lifetime Value (LTV), churn, and user upgrade behavior compared to the existing Standard plan.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

Netflix's product team is exploring two monetization paths:

- **Standard Tier**: $17.99/month — no new features
- **Premium Tier**: $29.99/month — includes a new built-in feature that enables seamless streaming even with poor internet

The Premium tier price was recently increased from **$25.99** to **$29.99**.

---

## 📊 Business Question

> Does introducing a Premium tier with a new feature at a higher price ($29.99) generate higher long-term revenue (LTV) than maintaining a Standard-only plan at $17.99, while keeping churn at an acceptable level?

---

## 📊 Hypotheses

### 1. 📈 **Primary Hypothesis – LTV Impact**

- **H₀**: No significant difference in average LTV between Premium and Standard tiers.
- **H₁**: Premium tier is at least 15% higher average projected LTV compared to the Standard tier.

### 2. 📈 **Secondary Hypothesis – Churn Risk**

- **H₀**: Churn rate remains the same or lower for the Premium tier.
- **H₁**: Churn rate for the Premium tier is at least 1.5x higher in Premium, potentially offsetting revenue gains by 5-10%.

### 3. 📈 **Behavioral Hypothesis – User Response**

- **H₀**: The premium tier does not lead to significantly improved user behavior. Retention and conversion remain the same or fall slightly, while the downgrade rate increases.
- **H₁**: Premium tier boosts LTV by at least 10%, driven by:
          ≥ 10% increase in conversion rate
          ≥ 15% decrease in downgrade rate
  	.. despite the higher monthly price of $29.99
